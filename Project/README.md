<h1 align="center"> KNIGHT MARKET </h1>

For students to sell unwanted items - such as furniture or textbooks- and buy or search for items they need, they would need a platform. While there are other apps like Facebook Marketplace or eBay out there that do this, they pose far more expensive prices and a greater distance to travel. What students need is a platform with the increased opportunity to quickly and easily sell their unwanted items, search for and buy items, and communicate with local students to receive their items from a physically shorter distance. With the natural barrier of distance eliminated, we hope it will encourage a practice of buying secondhand.

Our platform will easily allow sellers to post items they want to sell. Sellers are able to post pictures of their items, a title, a description, a price, and an email or phone number for contact information. Buyers will be browse through categories of items to find specific items they desire. Both buyers and sellers will require to login to make an account, so that the network of buyers and sellers is limited to those within the Calvin space.
